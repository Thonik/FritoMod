Features and Wishlist

## Predicate Builder

A UI for using Predicates to build up sophisticated callbacks without a lot
of headache. This work could possibly be rolled into the Asset system, with
constructed predicates being a provided asset.

## Catalog

A catalog is a compendium of WoW spell information. It'd be designed to
aggregate lots of different spell and ability information, like cooldowns
and buffs.

Something like this:

local types = Catalog.Types("Psychic Scream");
Assert.Equals({
	"CC",
	"Priest",
	"Fear"
}, types);

### Minimap Icon

The icon should be draggable. It should stack locked to the perimeter of the
minimap, but our draggable stuff doesn't yet support this. I'd like to have
draggable-like stuff like this be easy to use (meaning pluggable), but I'm not
quite sure how it should look yet.
