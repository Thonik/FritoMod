Testing: Revamp or remove
    The testing framework is incomplete. It should either be completed or scaled
back to something way simpler.

API: Separate into different addons
    API has no focus or limit; its classes should be separated into focused projects
so relevant code can be centralized by purpose, rather than by programming level.

Events: Remove while retaining functionality
    Events has two classes, both of which have outlived their usefulness.
EventDispatcher's dependencies should be resolved, and this class should be removed
altogether. IterationManager should be replaced once a much less complicated framework
is completed in Timing.
